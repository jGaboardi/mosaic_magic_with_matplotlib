# Mosaic Magic with Matplotlib

## Scipy 2023 Tutorial

Communicating scientific data often relies on making comparisons between multiple datasets.
Join the Matplotlib team to learn about creating multi-axis figures to display such data side-by-side.
This intermediate level tutorial will cover a variety of tools for making multi-axis figures.
Of particular focus will be the subplot_mosaic and the layout engines: tight, constrained, and compressed.
This tutorial will emphasize the use of Matplotlib's Object Oriented (OO) API and why that is generally recommended over the pyplot (plt) API.

This tutorial is designed for users of Matplotlib who want to learn more about how to lay out complicated figures.
Bring a figure you like that you want to replicate the layout of or one that you'd like to improve.
